      "In this essay, Paul Graham, the founder of Y Combinator, shares his insights on building successful startups. He emphasizes the importance of creating something people want and not worrying too much about the business model in the initial stages. Graham suggests that this approach could make a startup resemble a charity, as it focuses on providing value to users rather than making immediate profits. He uses examples like Craigslist and Google to illustrate this concept, and suggests that there might be potential for successful startups based on purely benevolent projects. However, he also acknowledges that not all good nonprofits would make good companies, as the success of a startup often depends on its users having the ability to pay. Graham concludes by suggesting that this idea might be worth exploring further, as it challenges traditional assumptions about the relationship between benevolence and profitability in startups.\n",

      "The article discusses the importance of being benevolent in business, using the examples of Google, Microsoft, and IBM. The author argues that being nice to customers and users in the early stages of a company can lead to success, as it improves morale, makes others want to help, and helps in being decisive. Microsoft, initially a benevolent company, lost its edge when it grew big and started maltreating customers. Google, on the other hand, has adopted the \"Don't be evil\" motto, which may help it stay youthful and competitive. The author also mentions that benevolence is important for startups, as it helps them keep going during tough times and attract investors.\n",

Instead, he suggests embracing the idea of being good as a strategic and effective approach. He argues that markets have evolved to value potential earnings and growth, and that companies with genuine growth and benevolent aims are valuable. However, he cautions against starting benevolent projects without holding oneself accountable for their effects. He also criticizes trustafarians for their feebly executed and often politically agenda-driven benevolent businesses.
