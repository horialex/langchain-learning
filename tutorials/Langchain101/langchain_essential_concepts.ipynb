      "- 2 tbsp olive oil\n",
      "- 1 onion, finely chopped\n",
      "- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 250 g mushrooms, finely chopped\n",
      "- 3 tbsp chopped fresh parsley\n",
      "- 3 tbsp chopped fresh thyme\n",
      "- Salt and black pepper, to taste\n",
      "- 500 g puff pastry, chilled\n",
      "- 1 egg, beaten\n",

      "1. Preheat the oven to 220¬∞C/425¬∞F/gas mark 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the beef fillet and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side until browned. Remove from the pan and set aside.\n",

      "3. In the same pan, add the onion and garlic and cook until soft. Add the mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and turn brown. Stir in the parsley and thyme. Season with salt and pepper.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Place the cooked beef fillet in the centre of a large piece of cling film. Spread the mushroom mixture over the beef, pressing down firmly to pack it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Roll out the pastry to form a rectangle large enough to enclose the beef. Place the pastry over the beef and wrap it tightly around the beef, pressing the edges together to seal. Brush the top of the pastry with the beaten egg.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Place the wrapped beef on a baking sheet and bake for 30-35 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown.\n",

      "\n",
      "To make this dish at home, start by preheating your oven to 220¬∞C/425¬∞F/gas mark 7. Next, heat some olive oil in a frying pan and sear the beef fillet until it's browned on all sides. Once cooked, remove the beef from the pan and set it aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, in the same frying pan, saut√© some finely chopped onions and garlic until they're soft. Then add some finely chopped mushrooms and continue cooking until they've released their moisture and turned brown. Stir in some chopped parsley and thyme, and season with salt and pepper to taste.\n",

Their decisions that did not result in mistakes have become conventional wisdom, making them appear less risky. Biographies often focus more on a scientist's successful contributions to their field, making it seem that their unerring judgment led them directly to previously unnoticed truths. However, the time spent by these scientists on other pursuits, such as alchemy and theology, may suggest that they were not always rational in their decision-making. A simpler explanation could be that successful people sometimes make questionable choices.\n",

In Newton's time, all three fields - physics, alchemy, and theology - seemed equally promising, as their potential payoffs were unknown. Newton's bets in these areas were all risky, and only one paid off. This underscores the importance of taking risks and the unpredictability of outcomes in any pursuit, whether considered smart or crazy.\"\n",
