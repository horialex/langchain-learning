Construction began in 1887 and took two years, two months, and five days to complete. It was opened to the public on March 31, 1889, as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair, which marked the centennial celebration of the French Revolution.\n",

The tower was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the Chrysler Building in New York City was completed in 1930. It was also the most visited paid monument in the world; 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015.\n",
      "\n",
